# autoloader
autoload applications on startup when System is having low load

### What
1. Takes in a list of apps to be loaded on startup.
2. Checks if system load is low
3. If it is low enough, loads the app

### Why
1. I shutdown computer everyday before going sleep (if you don't, maybe this is not for you).
2. Slack, Skype, Emacs takes a lot of time to load
